# Project: Building a Controller  

***
## All Required Steps for a Passing Submission have been completed:

1. The Writeup is created. 
2. The Controller has been Implemented.
3. My C++ controller is successfully able to fly the provided test trajectory   
   and visually passes inspection of the scenarios leading up to the test trajectory.

## [Rubric Points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1643/view) 
 Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

___
### 1. Writeup / README

_Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one._  

Current document is the **Writeup**

___
### 2. Implemented Controller   
#### *Setup*
   The development envirounment has been successfuly astableshed and   
 the first touch to code (_*Testing it Out*_) has passed with `Mass = 0.4848`
